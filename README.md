# DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION
- Github Repository: https://github.com/Rusty89/SeniorCenterManagmentStudio
- The latest stable/release version can be found on the 'master' branch of the GitHub repository.
- The 'develop' branch of the GitHub repository is used for development between stable releases.
* Directory Organization - 
- All HTML and CSS files are stored in the 'Web App HTML and CSS' folder.

## Build the Software
Run 'ng build'. The /dist folder is what will need to be uploaded to S3.

## Database
The database used for the project is AWS DynamoDB. This uses NoSQL, and uses json's to return the information to you. We used the AWS web console to build the tables, but you can also use boto3 to build the tables in python (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/dynamodb.html). You will need a table for members, activities, etc.
* Members table uses 'id' as the table key
* Activites uses 'act_id' as the table key

## Hosting
The angular build files are hosted in a AWS S3 bucket. This will load the angular app when you go to the domain set on the bucket, allowing you to host the app for free, and then can set up a domain name to point at the bucket it self. 

## API Gateway


## User login's
